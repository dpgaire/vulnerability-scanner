# Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview

The **Vulnerability Scanner** extension for Visual Studio Code scans your JavaScript code for potential security vulnerabilities and threats. It helps you identify common security issues and improve the security of your codebase.

## Features

- **Scan JavaScript Code**: Analyzes your code for potential vulnerabilities such as the use of `eval()`, `document.write()`, and other risky functions.
- **Security Alerts**: Provides warnings and suggestions for improving code security.
- **Customizable Rules**: Easily extendable with additional security rules and checks.

## Installation

### Via VS Code Marketplace

1. Open [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode).
2. Search for **Vulnerability Scanner**.
3. Click **Install**.

### Manual Installation

1. **Download the `.vsix` file**: [Download here](https://your-extension-url/vulnerability-scanner.vsix).
2. Open VS Code.
3. Go to the Extensions view by clicking the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
4. Click the three-dot menu icon in the top right corner and select **Install from VSIX...**.
5. Select the `.vsix` file you downloaded.

## Usage

### Scanning Code

1. Open the Command Palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P`.
2. Type and select **Scan Code for Vulnerabilities**.
3. The extension will analyze the currently active file or the selected code and display any security warnings in the Problems panel.

### Configuration

You can configure the extension to customize the types of vulnerabilities it scans for by editing the extension settings in your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "vulnerabilityScanner.rules": ["no-eval", "no-document-write"]
}
```

- **`no-eval`**: Warns about the usage of `eval()`.
- **`no-document-write`**: Warns about the usage of `document.write()`.

### Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how the extension flags code for potential vulnerabilities:

```javascript
// Code with potential security issues
eval("console.log('This is dangerous!')"); // Potential security issue: avoid using 'eval'
document.write("Hello, world!"); // Potential security issue: avoid using 'document.write'
```
